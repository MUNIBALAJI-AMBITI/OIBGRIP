                <p><b>"Red-Haired" Shanks,commonly known as just "Red Hair",is the captain of the Red Hair Pirates and one of the Four Emperors that rule over the New World.<br><br>
                    
                Shanks is a former member of the legendary Roger Pirates, the only pirate band to successfully conquer the Grand Line, starting out his pirate career on said crew as an apprentice alongside Buggy before forming his own crew after Gol D. Roger's death.<br><br>
                    
                Notably, Shanks is the pirate who inspired Monkey D. Luffy to go on his own pirate journey,and his crewmate Lucky Roux found the Gomu Gomu no Mi that was accidentally eaten by Luffy.He also owned the Straw Hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday.</b></p>
                
                <h1>Appearance</h1>
                
                <p><b>Shanks is a tall man (just under two meters),well-built, tan-complexioned, and in the prime of his mid-adulthood.Among the Four Emperors past and present, he stands out as the smallest, most normal-sized by far, the others being various degrees of inhuman proportions.<br><br>

                True to his epithet, Shanks has distinctly red hair: usually depicted across media as deep-crimsonish. Worthy of note is that, uniquely among all characters seen so far, even ones with a comparable hair tone, Shanks' hair is the sole one filled with grayscale in the black-and-white manga (instead of inked black or left white). Shanks' first-seen hairstyle was a straight, middle-parted one kept loosely down to nape length, with shorter (at eye level), curtained bangs in the front.In later appearances (at ten years older), he is shown with slightly longer hair, wavier and more slicked back than before except for some few strands he lets fall down the sides of his face, pushed farther sideward than said prior bangs</b></p>
                
                <h1>Abilities and Powers</h1>
                
                <p><b>As a former member of the Roger Pirates, chief of the Red Hair Pirates, and one of the Four Emperors in the New World, Shanks is known to be one of the four strongest pirates in the world. However, not much is known about Shanks' powers and abilities in detail.<br><br>

                Despite being the youngest of the Four Emperors, Shanks is on an equal level with the more experienced Kaidou, Charlotte Linlin, and even Whitebeard, who was feared as the strongest pirate in the World. Kaidou acknowledges Shanks as one of the very few powerful pirates capable of fighting him. It was also stated by the Five Elders that he is one of the few people capable of stopping Teach.Admiral Akainu fought through many men, a couple of Whitebeard's division commanders, and two former Warlords of the Sea to get to Luffy, but did not challenge Shanks when the Emperor appeared.<br><br>
                    
                    
                Shanks is one of the very small number of people in the world who can use all three types of Haki.Even Whitebeard complimented Shanks for his Haki when he used it on his visit, with Jozu stating it was overwhelming</b></p>
